## What is this?

My first template build with tailwind, inspired by this [screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JhTaENzfZQ). Watching Adam, do it make the whole process much easier, even though I did my own a week later.

Also, Adam made this look easy. Its not!

# 1.1 Setting up Tailwind and PostCSS

To get started, `cd` into this subfolder and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

Use `npm run build` to generate the compiled CSS, and a tool like [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) to preview the site in the browser.
